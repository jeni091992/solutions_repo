Theoretical Foundation Governing Equations The motion of a projectile under gravity (without air resistance) is governed by Newton\u2019s Second Law: \\[ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g \\] Solving these, we get the velocity components: \\[ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta, \\quad v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - gt \\] And the position equations: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t, \\quad y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, - \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle, - \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration. Finding the Range The range \\( R \\) is found by solving for \\( x \\) when \\( y = 0 \\) (projectile returns to ground): \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Substituting into the equation for \\( x \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\times \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the trigonometric identity \\( 2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta \\) , we get: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin 2\\theta \\] This shows the range depends on \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) , with a maximum at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . 2. Analysis of the Range The range is symmetric about \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) , meaning complementary angles (e.g., \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) ) result in the same range. Increasing \\( v_0 \\) increases \\( R \\) quadratically. Increasing \\( g \\) (e.g., on different planets) decreases the range. 3. Practical Applications Sports: Optimizing shot put, long jump, or soccer kicks. Military: Artillery calculations. Space Science: Designing launch angles for rockets. Adding complexities like air resistance leads to asymmetric trajectories and reduced range. 4.
