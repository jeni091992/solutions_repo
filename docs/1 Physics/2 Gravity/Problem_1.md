## Problem 1

### Orbital Period and Orbital Radius

---

### 1. Derivation of the Relationship

We start with Newtonâ€™s Law of Gravitation and the formula for centripetal force.

- **Gravitational Force:**  
  \[
  F_g = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
  \]

- **Centripetal Force:**  
  \[
  F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}
  \]

Equating the two forces for a body in circular orbit:

\[
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\]

Canceling \( m \) and solving for \( v \):

\[
v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
\]

The orbital period \( T \) is related to the velocity and orbital radius by:

\[
v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
\]

Substitute into the velocity equation:

\[
\left( \frac{2\pi r}{T} \right)^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
\]

\[
\frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{G M}{r}
\]

Solving for \( T^2 \):

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
\]

âœ… **This shows** that \( T^2 \propto r^3 \), which is **Keplerâ€™s Third Law** for circular orbits.

### 2. Implications for Astronomy

- This relationship allows astronomers to:
  - Determine the **mass of a central body** (e.g., a star or planet) by observing the motion of orbiting objects.
  - Calculate **orbital distances** when the period is known.
  - Model the structure and scale of planetary systems.
- It supports the understanding of **exoplanetary systems** by enabling inference of planetary positions and masses from light curves and Doppler shifts.
- It's essential in **satellite design** and **space mission planning**, ensuring correct orbital parameters for stable orbits.

### 3. Real-World Examples

#### Example 1: Moonâ€™s Orbit Around Earth

- Mean radius \( r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \)
- Orbital period \( T = 27.3 \, \text{days} = 2.36 \times 10^6 \, \text{s} \)

Calculate \( \frac{T^2}{r^3} \):

\[
\frac{(2.36 \times 10^6)^2}{(3.84 \times 10^8)^3} \approx 4.95 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s}^2/\text{m}^3
\]

#### Example 2: Earth's Orbit Around the Sun

- Radius \( r = 1.496 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m} \)
- Period \( T = 365.25 \, \text{days} = 3.156 \times 10^7 \, \text{s} \)

\[
\frac{(3.156 \times 10^7)^2}{(1.496 \times 10^{11})^3} \approx 2.97 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{s}^2/\text{m}^3
\]

These values align with Keplerâ€™s Law and confirm its consistency across vastly different systems.
