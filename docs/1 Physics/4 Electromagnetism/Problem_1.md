## Problem 1

### Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

---

#### 1. Introduction to Graph Theory for Circuits

- **Circuit Representation as a Graph:**  
  A circuit can be represented as a graph, where:
  - **Nodes** represent the junctions (connection points between resistors),
  - **Edges** represent resistors with weights equal to their resistance values.
  
  This graph-based approach allows for the use of graph theory algorithms to simplify and analyze complex electrical circuits.

- **Goal:**  
  The goal is to calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit by iteratively simplifying series and parallel resistor connections. This approach eliminates the need for manual identification of series and parallel connections and reduces the circuit to a single equivalent resistance.

---

#### 2. Algorithm Description

- **Identifying Series and Parallel Connections:**
  - **Series Connection:**  
    Resistors are in series if they are connected end-to-end with no intermediate junction. The equivalent resistance \( R_{\text{eq}} \) for two resistors \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in series is:
    \[
    R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2
    \]
  - **Parallel Connection:**  
    Resistors are in parallel if they share both ends at the same junction. The equivalent resistance \( R_{\text{eq}} \) for two resistors \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in parallel is:
    \[
    \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
    \]
    or equivalently:
    \[
    R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
    \]

- **Iterative Graph Reduction:**
  - The circuit is iteratively simplified by detecting series and parallel connections.
  - After identifying and simplifying a connection, the new equivalent resistor is added back to the graph.
  - This process repeats until only one equivalent resistance remains.

- **Handling Nested Configurations:**
  - For circuits with nested series and parallel connections, the algorithm applies the reduction rules recursively. If a combination of resistors is simplified into a single equivalent resistor, this newly formed resistor might itself be part of a more complex combination, requiring further simplification.

```python
def calculate_equivalent_resistance(circuit_graph):
    # Step 1: Simplify series connections
    while series_connections_exist(circuit_graph):
        simplify_series(circuit_graph)

    # Step 2: Simplify parallel connections
    while parallel_connections_exist(circuit_graph):
        simplify_parallel(circuit_graph)

    # Step 3: Return the final equivalent resistance
    return circuit_graph[0]  # Assuming only one node remains, holding the final equivalent resistance

def series_connections_exist(circuit_graph):
    # Check if there are any series connections
    for node in circuit_graph:
        if is_series_connection(node):
            return True
    return False

def parallel_connections_exist(circuit_graph):
    # Check if there are any parallel connections
    for node in circuit_graph:
        if is_parallel_connection(node):
            return True
    return False

def simplify_series(circuit_graph):
    # Find two resistors in series and combine them
    node = find_series_nodes(circuit_graph)
    combined_resistance = node[0].resistance + node[1].resistance
    remove_resistors(circuit_graph, node)
    add_combined_resistor(circuit_graph, node, combined_resistance)

def simplify_parallel(circuit_graph):
    # Find two resistors in parallel and combine them
    node = find_parallel_nodes(circuit_graph)
    combined_resistance = (node[0].resistance * node[1].resistance) / (node[0].resistance + node[1].resistance)
    remove_resistors(circuit_graph, node)
    add_combined_resistor(circuit_graph, node, combined_resistance)

    # Check if two resistors are in series
    return node.has_series_neighbors()

def is_parallel_connection(node):
    # Check if two resistors are in parallel
    return node.has_parallel_neighbors()

def find_series_nodes(circuit_graph):
    # Identify and return two nodes connected in series
    pass

def find_parallel_nodes(circuit_graph):
    # Identify and return two nodes connected in parallel
    pass

def remove_resistors(circuit_graph, nodes):
    # Remove the identified resistors from the graph
    pass

    # Add the new combined resistor to the graph
    pass
```

#### 4. Test Cases and Examples

- **Example 1: Simple Series and Parallel Combinations**
  - For a circuit with two resistors in series \( R_1 = 10 \, \Omega \) and \( R_2 = 5 \, \Omega \), the algorithm will compute:
    \[
    R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \Omega
    \]
  - For a circuit with two resistors in parallel \( R_1 = 10 \, \Omega \) and \( R_2 = 5 \, \Omega \), the algorithm will compute:
    \[
    R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{10 + 5} = \frac{50}{15} = 3.33 \, \Omega
    \]

- **Example 2: Nested Configurations**
  - A circuit where resistors are first simplified in series and then in parallel will be handled by recursively applying the series and parallel reduction steps until only one equivalent resistance remains.

- **Example 3: Complex Graph with Cycles**
  - For more complex circuits with cycles and multiple resistors, the algorithm will use depth-first or breadth-first search techniques to simplify the circuit and compute the final equivalent resistance.

#### 5. Efficiency and Potential Improvements

- **Efficiency:**
  - The algorithm performs well for small to moderately complex circuits. It iteratively reduces the graph, simplifying series and parallel connections.
  - As the number of resistors and connections grows, the time complexity may increase, as each step involves checking the graph for series or parallel connections.

- **Potential Improvements:**
  - **Cycle Detection:** For circuits with multiple loops, a more advanced approach for cycle detection (e.g., using Kirchhoff's circuit laws or a specialized algorithm for detecting cycles) could optimize the process.
  - **Graph Representation:** Optimizing the graph representation (e.g., using adjacency lists or matrices) could improve the efficiency of graph traversal.

#### 6. Conclusion

By using graph theory to represent and analyze electrical circuits, this algorithm simplifies the task of calculating the equivalent resistance. The iterative reduction of series and parallel connections provides an efficient method for handling both simple and complex circuits, including those with nested and cyclical resistor configurations.

This approach not only simplifies circuit analysis but also enhances the ability to automate and optimize the process, making it ideal for applications in circuit simulation and design.
