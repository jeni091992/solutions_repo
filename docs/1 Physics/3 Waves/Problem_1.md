## Problem 1

### Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

---

#### 1. Wave Equations and Superposition

- **Wave Equation for a Single Source:**  
  The displacement \( u \) at a point \( (x, y) \) on the water surface, due to a single point source located at \( (x_s, y_s) \), is given by the equation:  
  \[
  u(x, y, t) = A \cos(k \cdot r - \omega t + \phi)
  \]
  where:
  - \( A \) is the amplitude of the wave.
  - \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) is the wave number, with \( \lambda \) being the wavelength.
  - \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency, with \( f \) being the frequency of the wave.
  - \( r = \sqrt{(x - x_s)^2 + (y - y_s)^2} \) is the distance from the source to the observation point.
  - \( \phi \) is the initial phase.

- **Superposition Principle:**  
  When multiple sources emit waves, the total displacement at any point \( (x, y) \) on the water surface is the sum of the displacements from all the sources:  
  \[
  u_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A \cos(k \cdot r_i - \omega t + \phi_i)
  \]
  where \( N \) is the number of sources (the vertices of the polygon), and \( r_i \) is the distance from the point \( (x, y) \) to the \( i \)-th source.

---

#### 2. Mathematical Derivations

- **Displacement for Multiple Sources:**  
  Given that the sources are placed at the vertices of a regular polygon, the resulting displacement at any point \( (x, y) \) is the sum of the individual wave contributions from each vertex:
  \[
  u_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A \cos(k \cdot r_i - \omega t + \phi_i)
  \]
  where:
  - \( r_i = \sqrt{(x - x_s)^2 + (y - y_s)^2} \) is the distance from the source at \( (x_s, y_s) \) to the point \( (x, y) \).
  - \( N \) is the number of vertices in the polygon, with the sources placed at equal angles.

#### 4. Interference Patterns and Analysis

- **Constructive Interference:**  
  Constructive interference occurs when the waves from different sources meet in phase, leading to amplified displacement. These regions appear as peaks in the interference pattern.

- **Destructive Interference:**  
  Destructive interference happens when the waves from different sources meet out of phase, leading to cancellation. These regions appear as troughs or points of zero displacement in the interference pattern.

- **Effect of Source Configuration:**  
  The number and arrangement of sources (vertices of the polygon) will determine the pattern of constructive and destructive interference. A square configuration (4 sources) results in a symmetric pattern, while an equilateral triangle (3 sources) would create a different interference pattern with fewer peaks.

#### 6. Importance of Wave Interference

- **Wave Superposition:**  
  The principle of superposition plays a crucial role in understanding how waves interact. It allows us to predict the resulting wave pattern from multiple sources.
  
- **Applications:**  
  Wave interference patterns are seen in various real-world scenarios, such as water waves, light waves, and sound waves. Understanding how these patterns form can be applied in areas such as acoustics, optics, and oceanography.

### Conclusion

By simulating and analyzing the interference patterns on a water surface due to waves from multiple sources, we gain valuable insights into the nature of wave superposition. The patterns of constructive and destructive interference provide a clear illustration of how waves combine, and they can be used to explore deeper principles in wave physics.
